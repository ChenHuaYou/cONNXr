# 02 Code Overview

You will find all the source code inside `src`. There is also a folder with all the operators `operators`. The idea is to have one file per operator, and every operator should match a common defined interface (inputs/outputs)

TODO:
```
|__examples
|  |__example1
|__scripts
|__src
|  |__operators
|  |__xxx
|__test
```
